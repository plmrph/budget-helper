# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the Budget Helper application with a cleaner, more maintainable architecture. The current application has grown organically and suffers from code duplication, inconsistent patterns, and tight coupling between frontend and backend logic. The redesign will implement a clean separation between frontend (Svelte) and backend (FastAPI), with well-defined service interfaces and reusable components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean Architecture Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear separation between frontend and backend concerns, so that I can maintain and extend the application more easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is structured THEN the frontend SHALL only handle presentation and user interaction
2. WHEN business logic is needed THEN the backend SHALL handle all data processing, API integrations, and business rules
3. WHEN frontend communicates with backend THEN it SHALL use well-defined REST API interfaces
4. WHEN backend services communicate THEN they SHALL use direct method calls within the same process
5. WHEN the application runs THEN frontend and backend SHALL be containerized separately using Docker Compose

### Requirement 2: Unified YNAB Service Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a single, comprehensive YNAB service, so that all YNAB operations are centralized and consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YNAB authentication is needed THEN the service SHALL handle Personal Access Token authentication
2. WHEN YNAB data is requested THEN the service SHALL provide methods for budgets, accounts, transactions, categories, and payees
3. WHEN transactions are updated THEN the service SHALL use a single, unified update method regardless of field type
4. WHEN changes are made THEN the service SHALL coordinate with the history service to track transaction changes
5. WHEN data is needed THEN the service SHALL request it from the storage service rather than implementing its own caching

### Requirement 3: Pluggable Email Service Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean email service interface, so that different email providers can be supported without changing core logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN email authentication is needed THEN the service SHALL support pluggable authentication methods
2. WHEN email searching is performed THEN the service SHALL provide a unified search interface across providers
3. WHEN email data is retrieved THEN the service SHALL return normalized email objects regardless of provider
4. WHEN Gmail is used THEN the service SHALL implement the interface for Gmail API
5. WHEN future providers are added THEN they SHALL implement the same interface contract

### Requirement 4: AI Service with ML Library Abstraction

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI-powered transaction categorization that can work with different ML libraries, so that the system remains flexible and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training data is needed THEN the service SHALL pull and prepare data from the YNAB service
2. WHEN data cleaning is performed THEN the service SHALL handle duplicates, conflicts, and validation
3. WHEN model training occurs THEN the service SHALL support pluggable ML library implementations
4. WHEN models are managed THEN the service SHALL provide backup, restore, and versioning capabilities
5. WHEN predictions are made THEN the service SHALL return consistent prediction objects regardless of underlying ML library

### Requirement 5: Unified Storage Service Interface

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a consistent storage interface, so that different storage backends can be used without changing application logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is stored THEN the service SHALL provide CRUD operations for all entity types
2. WHEN backups are created THEN the service SHALL support full and incremental backup strategies
3. WHEN data is restored THEN the service SHALL handle restoration from backup files
4. WHEN storage backends change THEN the interface SHALL remain consistent
5. WHEN data is cleared THEN the service SHALL provide selective and complete clearing options

### Requirement 6: History Service for Change Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track and undo changes to my transactions, so that I can easily revert mistakes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transactions are modified THEN the service SHALL automatically record the change
2. WHEN change history is requested THEN the service SHALL provide a chronological list of modifications
3. WHEN undo is requested THEN the service SHALL revert the change and sync with YNAB
4. WHEN multiple changes exist THEN the service SHALL support selective undo operations
5. WHEN storage is needed THEN the service SHALL integrate with the storage service interface

### Requirement 7: Cross-Cutting Settings Service

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent settings management across all features, so that my preferences are maintained and easily accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN settings are accessed THEN the service SHALL provide a unified interface for all configuration types
2. WHEN email search preferences are set THEN they SHALL be persisted and applied consistently
3. WHEN display preferences are changed THEN they SHALL be immediately reflected in the UI
4. WHEN theme settings are modified THEN they SHALL be applied across all components
5. WHEN AI configurations are updated THEN they SHALL be validated and stored securely

### Requirement 8: Reusable UI Components

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent, reusable UI components, so that the interface is uniform and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is needed THEN a single, configurable auth component SHALL be used
2. WHEN settings are displayed THEN a consistent settings layout SHALL be applied
3. WHEN data tables are shown THEN a unified table component SHALL handle sorting, filtering, and pagination
4. WHEN forms are created THEN standardized form components SHALL ensure consistent validation and styling
5. WHEN modals are displayed THEN a consistent modal system SHALL be used throughout the application

### Requirement 9: Comprehensive Testing Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit tests for all service interfaces, so that I can refactor with confidence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are implemented THEN unit tests SHALL cover all public interface methods
2. WHEN tests are written THEN they SHALL focus on interface contracts rather than implementation details
3. WHEN mocking is needed THEN tests SHALL use interface-based mocks
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL be fast and independent of external services
5. WHEN interfaces change THEN tests SHALL clearly indicate breaking changes

### Requirement 10: Docker Compose Development Environment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a containerized development environment, so that setup is consistent and dependencies are isolated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the development environment starts THEN Docker Compose SHALL orchestrate frontend and backend containers
2. WHEN code changes are made THEN hot reloading SHALL work for both frontend and backend
3. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be managed within containers
4. WHEN databases are required THEN they SHALL be included in the compose setup
5. WHEN the environment is torn down THEN all resources SHALL be properly cleaned up
